# Network Tracking using Wireshark and Google Maps

This guide provides a **comprehensive breakdown** of a Python project that visualizes IP communication paths from a packet capture (`.pcap` file) using Google Maps/KML and the GeoLiteCity database. Each line is explained, including its purpose, how it fits in network forensics, threats, and practical tips.

***

## Introduction

Network monitoring and geo-location mapping are crucial in cybersecurity for tracking malicious traffic, forensic analysis, and incident response. This project parses packets captured by Wireshark, extracts IP addresses, geo-locates them, and renders their network journey visually for investigators.

***

## Dependencies and Imports

```python
import dpkt
import socket
import pygeoip
```

- **Why Used**
    - `dpkt`: Parses packets from `pcap` files (used by Wireshark), lets you inspect layers such as Ethernet and IP.
    - `socket`: Provides functions for network operations; here, it decodes binary IPs to human-readable text.
    - `pygeoip`: Looks up IP addresses in a geolocation database, mapping IPs to cities/coordinates.
- **Context**
These libraries are vital in cybersecurity for traffic analysis, correlating network events with physical locations and forensic tracing.

***

## GeoIP Database Initialization

```python
gi = pygeoip.GeoIP('GeoLiteCity.dat')
```

- **Why Used**
Initializes the GeoIP lookup object with the MaxMind `GeoLiteCity.dat` database. This allows fast lookups of longitude/latitude for IPs.
- **Details**
The `.dat` file must be downloaded from MaxMind. It is a commonly used free database for geolocation in incident response.

***

## KML String Builder Function

```python
def retKML(dstip, srcip):
    dst = gi.record_by_name(dstip)
    src = gi.record_by_name('192.168.0.8')
    try:
        dstlongitude = dst['longitude']
        dstlatitude = dst['latitude']
        srclongitude = src['longitude']
        srclatitude = src['latitude']
        kml = (
            '<Placemark>\n'
            '<name>%s</name>\n'
            '<extrude>1</extrude>\n'
            '<tessellate>1</tessellate>\n'
            '<styleUrl>#transBluePoly</styleUrl>\n'
            '<LineString>\n'
            '<coordinates>%6f,%6f\n%6f,%6f</coordinates>\n'
            '</LineString>\n'
            '</Placemark>\n'
        )%(dstip, dstlongitude, dstlatitude, srclongitude, srclatitude)
        return kml
    except:
        return ''
```


### Line-by-Line Explanation

- **Function:** `retKML` creates a KML (Keyhole Markup Language) snippet for Google Maps showing the route between a source and destination IP.
- **`gi.record_by_name(dstip)`:**
Looks up the public IP (`dstip`) for geo-location.
- **`gi.record_by_name('192.168.0.8')`:**
Hardcoded to local/private network IP—for demo, should be changed to dynamic source.
- **Try-Except Block:**
Ensures missing/invalid records don’t crash execution.
- **Extracting Coordinates:**
Pulls longitude/latitude for both IPs; used to draw a line in KML.
- **KML Formatting:**
Sets up Google Maps-style markup, naming each connection by IP, styling with blue lines, and encoding coordinates.
- **`return kml`:**
If all coordinates available, return the string; else return empty on exception.

***

## Packet Plotting Function

```python
def plotIPs(pcap):
    kmlPts = ''
    for (ts, buf) in pcap:
        try:
            eth = dpkt.ethernet.Ethernet(buf)
            ip = eth.data
            src = socket.inet_ntoa(ip.src)
            dst = socket.inet_ntoa(ip.dst)
            KML = retKML(dst, src)
            kmlPts = kmlPts + KML
        except:
            pass
    return kmlPts
```


### Line-by-Line Explanation

- **Function:** `plotIPs` processes each packet in the capture file, extracts Ethernet/IP details, calls `retKML` to get mapping data.
- **Looping:** `for (ts, buf) in pcap:`
Iterates over every packet; `ts` is timestamp (unused here).
- **Parsing Ethernet Frame:**
`dpkt.ethernet.Ethernet(buf)` decodes raw bytes into readable fields (Ethernet frame).
- **IP Object:**
`.data` attribute gives IP header object inside Ethernet frame.
- **Source/Destination IPs:**
`socket.inet_ntoa(ip.src)` and `socket.inet_ntoa(ip.dst)` convert raw bytes to readable IPv4 addresses.
- **Building KML:**
Calls `retKML` for each packet’s destination/source, appends results to overall string.
- **Error Handling:**
If any packet is malformed, skip it to ensure robust analysis.

***

## Main Routine

```python
def main():
    f = open('mac_data.pcap', 'rb')
    pcap = dpkt.pcap.Reader(f)
    kmlheader = '<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?> \n<kml xmlns="http://www.opengis.net/kml/2.2">\n<Document>\n'\
    '<Style id="transBluePoly">' \
                '<LineStyle>' \
                '<width>1.5</width>' \
                '<color>501400E6</color>' \
                '</LineStyle>' \
                '</Style>'
    kmlfooter = '</Document>\n</kml>\n'
    kmldoc=kmlheader+plotIPs(pcap)+kmlfooter
    print(kmldoc)
```


### Line-by-Line Explanation

- **Opening Packet File:**
Reads packet capture file in binary mode (from Wireshark, etc.).
- **PCAP Reader:**
Decodes packets using dpkt’s PCAP reader.
- **KML Header/Footer:**
Prepares KML document with style for Google Earth/Maps.
- **Combining Plots:**
Appends header, all computed KML Placemarks, and footer for a full document.
- **Output:**
Prints the entire KML, ready for mapping/visualization tools.

***

## Script Entry Point

```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

- **Why Used:**
Ensures `main()` runs only when script is executed as main file, not when imported.
- **Standard Practice:**
This allows code reusability and modularity, which are recommended in professional projects.

***

## Real-World Incident Examples

1. **2014 JP Morgan Chase Breach**
Attackers exploited network vulnerabilities and exfiltrated data over specific paths. Investigation mapped traffic routes using pcap and geo-location to identify compromised nodes globally.
2. **2017 WannaCry Ransomware**
The spread analysis relied on network tracking with Wireshark and IP geo-mapping to visualize how the worm propagated through different countries, helping incident teams in containment.
3. **2018 Iranian Cyber-Espionage Campaign**
Researchers used packet captures and IP geolocation to connect attacks against European targets to servers in Iran, building visual threat maps for government response.
4. **2020 SolarWinds Attack**
Forensic teams visualized the flow of malicious traffic between infected systems and command-and-control servers using similar methods to trace and mitigate network exposure.

### Packet Plotting Function

```python
def plotIPs(pcap):
    kmlPts = ''
    for (ts, buf) in pcap:
        try:
            eth = dpkt.ethernet.Ethernet(buf)
            ip = eth.data
            src = socket.inet_ntoa(ip.src)
            dst = socket.inet_ntoa(ip.dst)
            KML = retKML(dst, src)
            kmlPts = kmlPts + KML
        except:
            pass
    return kmlPts
```

- **Functionality:**
Iterates over all packets, decodes layers to extract source and destination IPs, and generates the corresponding KML for each connection.
- **Resilience:**
Skips malformed or non-IP packets (e.g., ARP frames), ensuring robustness for diverse capture files.
- **Integration:**
Aggregates all results into one KML data block for easy visual import.

***

### Main Routine

```python
def main():
    f = open('mac_data.pcap', 'rb')
    pcap = dpkt.pcap.Reader(f)
    kmlheader = '<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?> \n<kml xmlns="http://www.opengis.net/kml/2.2">\n<Document>\n'\
